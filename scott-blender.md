## Research Interests
I am interested in autonomous guidance, navigation, and control and applying machine learning to space mission design. Right now, I am focused on developing an autonomous guidance algorithm for low-thrust spacecraft, incorporating state uncertainty using the Unscented Transform, into dataset generation for model training.
