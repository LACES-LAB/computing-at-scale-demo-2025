## Research Interests
My current research is about MEMS electrostatic harvesters. I am trying to understand the energy conversion limit in an electrostatic harvester wherein I am simulating a coupled oscillator system using MATLAB code. My research involves a lot of data generation and data savings. I also need to solve a lot of math equations for which I need a code/software that helps me solve complex equations as well as automize my data generation.
